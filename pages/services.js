                    Plastics and other vinyl-like interior surfaces are very
                    susceptable to damage from the sun over time, as well as
                    from natural body oils. <br />
                    <br />
                    This sun damage mainly causes the color to fade. So rather
                    than the deep color that was there from the factory, the
                    plastics begin to look a bit develop. Protecting and
                    conditioning these surfaces is vital to keeping them looking
                    fantastic.

                    The first glance that people give to cars is usually
                    straight to the wheels.

                    <br />
                    Over time, wheels tend to gather lots of brake dust from
                    continuous brake pad wear while driving. This break dust
                    builds up on the wheel and can actually embed itself into
                    the wheel, causing permanant damage if not taken care of.
                    Not to mention, clean wheels just look fantastic. Along with
                    getting that brake dust taken care of, applying a fresh coat
                    of tire shine, cleaning the wheel wells, and inner barrel of
                    the wheel are also taken care of.

                    Leather is important to maintain. Over time, if cared for
                    correctly, it develops a wonderful finish called a patina,
                    or a 'sheen'. This adds a bit of character to the leather.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is caused by the sun, dirt particles, and your natural
                    body oils. If cared for improperly, leather starts to crack
                    and actually lose some of it's color.

                    Carpets are often overlooked because we're always stepping
                    about on them, but the cleanliness of carpets actually
                    effect the experience quite a lot. Past the obvious visual
                    appearance, they tend to hold the majority of whatever smell
                    seems to be locked in the car.

                    Also, a renewed plush and deep colored carpet is a great way

                    Paint can make all the difference visually.

                    <br />
                    Firstly, (if paint clearly contains contaminants), a clay
                    bar will be used to safely extract the contaminants that are
                    embeded into the paint. Secondly, after the paint is smooth
                    to the touch and lacking any grit feeling, wax will be
                    applied. Wax creates a hydrophobic effect, making water bead
                    off the surface rather than sheeting off.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Along with the beading, wax provides an incredible gloss to
                    the paint, as well as very smooth to the touch (I recommend
                    avoiding contact though, without any lubrication that is.).
